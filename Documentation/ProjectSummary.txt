A common problem with remote sensor systems is the retrieval of data. Satellite-based systems are expensive, as is travelling to the sensor. Thankfully, ionospheric propagation comes to the rescue! Radio signals below about 30MHz can easily bounce off the ionosphere, travelling thousands of kilometres, using only a few watts of transmit power.Based around an Atmel XMega Micro-Controller and using Direct Digital Synthesis techniques, this project aims to provide a reliable low power HF telemetry system, usable in a variety of remote telemetry applications.
