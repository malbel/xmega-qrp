In the literature on whistle-blowing, some have proposed that blowing the whistle is acceptable provided that certain conditions are met. What are these conditions and what are the reasons for requiring these conditions be met? Could it ever be justified to blow the whistle when some of these conditions are not met? Use an example (real or imagined) to illustrate your answer to this question.

Sissela Bok - Whistleblowing & Professional Responsibility
- Seek objective advice before going public.
- Be aware of arguments for and against whistleblowing

Ronald Duska - Whistleblowing and Employee Loyalty
- Argues that there is no obligation of loyalty to a company.
- Loyalty does not go both ways with a company
	- A company will fire an employee if they do not perform.
	- No 'loyalty' to the employee.
- A company is really only tied together by money.
- Whistleblowing is *expected* when a company is harming society.
